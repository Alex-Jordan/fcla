If the first system is homogeneous, then the zero vector is in the solution set of the system.  (See the proof of \acronymref{theorem}{HSC}.)\par
%
Since the two systems are equivalent, they have equal solutions sets (\acronymref{definition}{ESYS}).  So the zero vector is in the solution set of the second system.  By \acronymref{exercise}{HSE.T10} the presence of the zero vector in the solution set implies that the system is homogeneous.\par

So if any one of two equivalent systems is homogeneous, then they both are homogeneous.
